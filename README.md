## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<h3>Recognizing human activities and monitoring population behavior are fundamental needs of our society. Population security, crowd surveillance, healthcare support, living assistance, lifestyle and behavior tracking are some of the main applications that require the recognition of human activities.But, if oneâ€™s health deteriorate due to unhealthy lifestyle, clinical tests and diagnosis are time-consuming. Keeping track of all the human activities is not possible always and is mundane prone!
</h3>

## SOLUTION

<h3>

This task can be automated with the power of machine learning and deep learning. 

This project is about an automatic human activity recognizer to detect activities.

These are classified as regular physical movements and form our class of activity which is to be recognized using smartphone to help make students,people healthy.
</h3>

## OBJECTIVE

<h3>The main objective of this project  is to recognize the type of physical activity the user is performing accurately, using the sensors of the phone.</h3>

## RESEARCH 

<h3>Although many people view exercise as a way to lose weight, it plays a key role in the wellbeing of the body beyond weight loss. Research strongly supports its benefits across a range of physical and mental health conditions for people of all ages. However, busy lifestyles and an environment that encourages being sedentary for many hours of the day (driving door-to-door, sitting at an office desk, relaxing for the evening in front of a television) have led to exercise ranking low as a priority for many people.
